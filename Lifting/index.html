            <p>Hosted by Pridefit Gym, Lifting Spirits is a full day of competitive lifting that supports
                early-childhood health initiatives in the Twin Cities. Show your strength and help kids thrive—what
                could be a better way to spend a Saturday?</p>
            <p>When you join as a competitor, you'll raise more money with every pound you lift. Not up for pumping
                iron? No problem—Lifting Spirits is just as fun for spectators. Your admission fee goes directly to our
                partner charities. Cheer on your friends and family and witness stunning feats of strength for a great
                cause.</p>

        <p class="detailsContainer__summary">The festivities start at 10 a.m. Then, the lifting begins with eight
            different divisions competing in five event categories. Meanwhile, bands will play and vendors will dish out
            food and drink (with lots of health-conscious options, of course). Come join the fun!</p>
